Concept
The Hierarchical Model organizes data in a tree structure. Each parent node can have multiple child nodes, but each child node has only one parent. This model is efficient for one-to-many relationships.

Real-World Analogy
Think of an organizational chart where each manager (parent) oversees multiple employees (children), but each employee reports to only one manager.
