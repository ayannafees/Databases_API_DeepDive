Overview
1960s: Emergence of DBMS
In the 1960s, the concept of Database Management Systems (DBMS) emerged to centralize data storage and management, moving away from the inefficient and inconsistent file-based systems. Two primary models dominated this era:

Hierarchical Model
Network Model
Hierarchical vs. Network Models
Hierarchical Model:

Structure: Tree-like, where each record has a single parent, forming a strict hierarchy.
Example Systems: IBM's IMS (Information Management System).
Network Model:

Structure: Graph-like, allowing multiple parent and child records, enabling more complex relationships.
Example Systems: CODASYL DBTG (Database Task Group).
