As programming paradigms evolved, particularly with the rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), database systems adapted to better integrate with these methodologies. This led to the development of Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS) and subsequently Object-Relational DBMS (ORDBMS). These models aimed to bridge the gap between the object-oriented application code and the database's data storage mechanisms.
