Understanding Horizontal Scaling and Sharding
Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal Scaling refers to adding more machines or nodes to a system to distribute the load and manage increased data volume. Unlike Vertical Scaling, which involves enhancing the capabilities of a single machine (e.g., adding more CPU or RAM), horizontal scaling improves performance and reliability by leveraging multiple machines.

Sharding
Sharding is a method of horizontal scaling where the dataset is partitioned into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is stored on a separate database instance or server. Sharding ensures that no single database becomes a bottleneck, enhancing both scalability and performance.

Key Concepts:

Shard Key: A specific field used to determine the distribution of data across shards.
Shard: A subset of the overall dataset stored on a separate database instance.
Balancing: Ensuring data is evenly distributed to prevent any shard from becoming overloaded.

Scenario Overview
Imagine you're building a large-scale application that manages user profiles. As the number of users grows, a single database becomes insufficient to handle the load efficiently. To address this, you'll implement sharding to distribute user data across multiple MongoDB databases based on the userId.

Objectives:

Distribute Data: Split user data across multiple shards based on userId.
Balance Load: Ensure each shard handles an approximately equal amount of data.
Maintain Accessibility: The application should transparently interact with the appropriate shard without manual intervention.
