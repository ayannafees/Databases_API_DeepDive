Implementing Sharding in Node.js
Prerequisites
Install Node.js: Download and install from Node.js Official Website.
Install MongoDB: Download and install from MongoDB Official Website. Alternatively, you can use Docker to run multiple MongoDB instances.
Basic Knowledge: Familiarity with JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB operations.
Step 1: Initialize a Node.js Project
Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm.


mkdir sharding-example
cd sharding-example
npm init -y
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the MongoDB Node.js driver.


npm install mongodb
Step 3: Configure Shards
For demonstration purposes, we'll set up two MongoDB databases (shards). In a real-world scenario, shards are typically distributed across different servers or clusters.

Assumptions:

Shard 1: mongodb://localhost:27017/shard1
Shard 2: mongodb://localhost:27018/shard2
Note: Ensure both MongoDB instances are running on your local machine on different ports.

Starting Multiple MongoDB Instances:

If you have MongoDB installed locally, you can start multiple instances using different ports. Alternatively, use Docker to simplify the process.

Using Docker:

Start Shard 1:


docker run -d --name shard1 -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
Start Shard 2:


docker run -d --name shard2 -p 27018:27017 mongo:latest
Note: Docker maps port 27017 inside the container to 27018 on the host for Shard 2.
